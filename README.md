# Favourite-food-app
A project using HTML and CSS where if we click on the food name will take us directly on the food image and description with smooth scrolling effect.

This is a very basic project with HTML bookmarking feature used as a main highlight.
Behind the scenes, I have used scrolling effect everywhere.
